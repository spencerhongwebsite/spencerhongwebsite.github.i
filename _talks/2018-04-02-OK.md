Computational solvation models enable us to simulate chemical reactions and processes that occur in solution, a particularly difficult environment to explore experimentally. However, determining how to accurately represent the solvent environment in computational simulations has inherent trade-offs in accuracy and computational cost. There are two main classes of solvation models: An implicit model is represented only by an electric field, using the relative dielectric of a solvent and lacks atomic details...
