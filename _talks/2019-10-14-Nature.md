Most of the current efforts to chemically reduce CO<sub>2</sub> requires H<sub>2</sub>, which is undesirable since ~95% of H<sub>2</sub> is generated from hydrocarbon-based feedstock, producing CO<sub>2</sub> as a byproduct. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need to find better alternatives to replace H<sub>2</sub> for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. Shale gas primarily consists of methane but also contains a significant amount of underutilized ethane (up to ∼10%). Recent efforts in converting CO<sub>2</sub> through ethane present a promising direction for CO<sub>2</sub> conversion, but the economic feasibility for this process remains unexplored.
Herein we report a techno-economic analysis (TEA) for CO2 reduction with ethane using process simulations via ASPEN. Two reaction pathways were examined: dry reforming of ethane (DRE) with CO2 via the C–C bond scission to produce syngas (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + 2CO<sub>2</sub> → 4CO + 3H<sub>2</sub>), and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 (ODEC) via the C–H bond scission to produce ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> → C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + CO + H<sub>2</sub>O). For DRE, syngas can be used in methanol synthesis and the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) process to produce higher hydrocarbon and oxygenates. For ODEC, the C-C bond in ethane could be preserved and used for building valuable olefins.
