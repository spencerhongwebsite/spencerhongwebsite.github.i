Description of Class
======
Design and analysis of processes involving chemical change. Students learn strategies for design, such as creative thinking, conceptual blockbusting, and (re)definition of the design goal, in the context of contemporary chemical and biomolecular engineering. Includes methods for analyzing designs, such as mathematical modeling, empirical analysis by graphics, and dynamic scaling through dimensional analysis, to assess product quality, economics, safety, and environmental issues.

Roles
======
I was tasked with creating problem sets to include fundamental concepts of chemical engineering, including but not limited to: mass and energy balances, problem solving, process analysis, and basic thermodynamics. I also graded problem sets and exams. Weekly office hours were held to support the students.

I also gave a guest lecture for 55 minutes, covering key concepts that were tested on a preliminary exam the day after. 

I received 4.7 mean rating out of 5 for my work as a TA with a group of 70+ engineering students.
