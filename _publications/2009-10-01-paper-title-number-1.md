Computational methods, including density functional theory, are proving to be powerful approaches to tame the otherwise overwhelming selection of optimal species and processing conditions to fabricate hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite (HOIP) thin films via solution processing. In that processing, the choice of solvents is known to play a critical role in the quality of the resulting thin film, but their inclusion in a simulation dominates the overall size of the system, and hence the computational effort. This creates an incentive to understand the minimal representation of solvent medium necessary to adequately model the interactions between HOIP building blocks...
