Chemical Engineer & Computational Researcher
======
I am a chemical engineering senior at Cornell University. As an undergraduate researcher for the [Clancy Group](https://clancygroup.wse.jhu.edu/) and the [Erickson Group](https://www.ericksonlab.org/), I am using molecular dynamics, density functional theory, and ASPEN Plus to study solar cell materials and CO2 catalytic conversion. As the Vice President of [American Institute of Chemical Engineers - Cornell](https://cornellaiche.org), I am pushing diversity and outreach initiatives here in Ithaca. As a consultant for the US Air Force, I am using machine learning algorithms to predict unknown toxicity of chemicals for pilots.

My CV can be found [here](https://spencerhong.com/files/cv.pdf). 

Before becoming a US Citizen, I was born in South Korea. I am fluent in Korean and learning Mandarin Chinese.

In my free time, I am an avid skier, practicing both alpine and telemark styles. I am an aspiring powerlifter, and film myself playing fingerstyle guitar covers on the side.
